Welcome to slide-seq-pipeline documentation!
===================================

**slide-seq-pipeline** This pipeline replicates most of the stuff provided in `official slide-seq <https://github.com/MacoskoLab/slideseq-tools>`_ except 
the dependence to the google sheet and assumed internal file/folder location. We lack some of the generalization as these scripts 
are meant to run on a local machine. I would highly recommend installing the actual package since some of the functions are directly used 
in this repo.   



Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
